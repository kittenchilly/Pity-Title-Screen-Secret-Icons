# Pity Title Screen Secret Icons

If you have already destroyed 1000 icons on the title screen without having unlocked both of the secret icons, a pity system kicks in and always spawns the icons you need until you get the achievement.

Due to the sheer amount of icons nowadays, it takes a mind-numbingly long time to get these 2 achievements in 2.2, compared to previous versions where there were less icons that could spawn on the title screen. This mod hopefully alleviates the struggle.

You can safely disable/uninstall the mod if you have unlocked both icons.
